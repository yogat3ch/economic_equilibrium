<h3>Tools for Economic Equity</h3>

<p>Grappling with the challenging question and consequences of income
    inequality in the midst of a 30-day meditation retreat, it became clear
    that if we value one another as equals and act from a place of mutual
    respect, starting from this moment forward, we will eventually create a
    more equitable and just economy. Inspired by this simple wish for
    greater economic equity in America, the Economic Equilibrium Sliding
    Scale was born.</p>

<p>The principle behind this app is a synthesis of the tradition of
    offering Dana, the Pali word for generosity. It is a word that connotes
    the virtue and a practice of making offerings in the Buddhist tradition.
    The livelihood, food, medicine, and housing of the monastic community is
    made possible by dana. The practice continues in the West with Dharma
    teachers offering their wisdom freely with the intention for it to
    liberate others. Those learning from the teacher are encouraged to offer
    dana if they find the teachings to be of benefit. Because this practice
    of being gifted freely and offering dana in return is foreign to most
    practitioners in the Western world, they can sometimes flounder in
    trying to find an appropriate amount to offer.</p>

<p>In the spirit of mutual respect and generosity, this app performs the
    math to make donations or transactions proportional to one's wealth.</p>

<h4>Methodology</h4>

<p>The app uses economic data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
    2022 <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm" target="_blank">Survey
        of Consumer Finances</a> on net worth. The munging of the data is based
    on the work of <a
        href="https://www.convey-r.org/1.6-survey-of-consumer-finances-scf.html#survey-of-consumer-finances-scf"
        target="_blank">Guilherme Jacob of Convey-r.org</a>. You can
    view the Qmd of the munging here</p>

<h5>Net Worth Percentile Calculator</h5>

<p>BLS data on net worth, stratified by age, is used to create an
    empirical cumulative distribution function from which a percentile of
    net worth can be rendered. Provide an age, and values for fixed net
    worth, fluid net worth, and debts and liabilities to compute the
    percentile of net worth. Each question provides guidance on
    how to provide the correct value.</p>

<p>A percentile calculation can be saved with a name for use in the
    Sliding Scale, but it is not necessary to do so.</p>

<h5>Sliding Scale</h5>

<p>The Sliding Scale uses the percentile of net worth and age of both
    participants to calculate a sliding scale for donations or transactions.
    The app uses the percentile of the net worth to scale the net worth to
    the same age, and then computes a scaling factor based on the magnitude
    of difference between the net worths. The scaling factor is multiplied
    by the base rate to suggest an amount that is proportional to the total
    net worth. It may be surprising what a proportional offering is if you
    happen to be the beneficiary of wealth in Western society.</p>

<p>My hope is that this app provides guidance to live in accord with the
    heartfelt wish for a world with greater equality, liberty, and
    opportunity for everyone</p>
